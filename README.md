# {coding standards}

Like many developers I have a certain style to all my code. I have decided to enumerate them here along with an accompanying eslint rule or accessability related reasoning for its use.

## Installing the standards

TODO

## 1. Spacing

### 1.1 Indentation eslint:[indent](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent)

All indentation should be done with tabs. 

#### Why?
This is to allow for greater accessability for persons with limited sightedness. Read more about it in [Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/).
